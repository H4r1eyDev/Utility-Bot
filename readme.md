If you're struggling to set this up join my [Discord](https://discord.gg/ksv9GaZJ74) for support! You can view some better products via my [store](https://h4r1ey-dev.xyz)!

### THIS IS AN OLD UTILITY BOT, IT IS SUGGESTED!
Even though it is suggested, I've learn a lot more, hence I'm releasing this for complete free!

You will need node.js and an editing software to be able to edit the config. I don't suggest using notepad as it can look odd and harder to understand. If you're experiencing issues with the bot then please report it via the Discord or fork with a fix. If you're going to fork please only fork the bug-fixes.

### Why release it if it is suggested? 
I wanted to release as I've learn **A LOT** more, and can make a lot better bots. You can use this as an example of my work, but don't hold it to be the best. I've got some of the better products on my store. You can view my store here: https://h4r1ey-dev.xyz.

### I don't want to install node.js and an editing software, but I want to run the bot. 
If you do not want to download it on your personal computer, you could a VPS from [Snowside Hosting](https://snowsidehosting.com) (Highly suggested hosting company) and download/host it there. Please remember to have this bot online 24/7 you must have a hosting or leave your computer on 24/7 *I don't suggest leaving your computer on 24/7. LOL*

### I have found a bot breaking bug, and my bot is now completely broken.
If you've edited then I will not help you. If it is standard code downloaded off github then I will assist you!

---
### Why is some of the code in another language / Why is odd letters/numbers?
It is because this was originally a paid release, I cannot at this time remember what it does and don't want to break the bot, if you leave it as it is then it should work. I am pretty sure it's only the start-up that uses it.

### Where is the event handler? 
There isn't one. I forsome reason didn't use one at the time .. Hence there ain't that many events ... I know, stupid of me.
