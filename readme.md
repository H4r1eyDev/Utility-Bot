If you're struggling to set this up join my [Discord](https://discord.gg/ksv9GaZJ74) for support! You can view some better products via my [store](https://h4r1ey-dev.xyz)!

### THIS IS AN OLD UTILITY BOT, IT IS SUGGESTED!
Even though it is suggested, I've learn a lot more, hence I'm releasing this for complete free!

You will need node.js and an editing software to be able to edit the config. I don't suggest using notepad as it can look odd and harder to understand. If you're experiencing issues with the bot then please report it via the Discord or fork with a fix. If you're going to fork please only fork the bug-fixes.

### Why release it if it is suggested? 
I wanted to release as I've learn **A LOT** more, and can make a lot better bots. You can use this as an example of my work, but don't hold it to be the best. I've got some of the better products on my store. You can view my store here: https://h4r1ey-dev.xyz.
